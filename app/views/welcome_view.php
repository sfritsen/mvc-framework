    The Danish word "Pyt" is usually expressed as an interjection in reaction to a daily hassle, 
    frustration or mistake.
</p>

<p>
    “Don’t worry about it,” “stuff happens” or “oh, well” ... all translate in English from Pyt. 
    Essentially Pyt was inspired by frequent usage of popular PHP frameworks such as Laravel and CodeIgniter. 
    It isn't magic but it will help you create applications faster with less hassle.

<p>
    Pyt is still in early development and was originally started as a learning project.  Please do not use Pyt 
    for production sites as many features are still missing.
